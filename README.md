This Python script is a simple implementation of the classic game "Snake" using the turtle module for graphics. The game is set up with a blue screen and a yellow square representing food. The snake is represented as a series of squares that move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The snake's movement is controlled by the arrow keys. The game starts with the snake in the middle of the screen, moving upwards. The snake moves forward in its current direction every few milliseconds, and the player can change its direction using the arrow keys. If the snake collides with the food, the food is repositioned randomly, and the snake grows longer. If the snake collides with itself, the game resets. If the snake moves off the edge of the screen, it wraps around to the other side.
